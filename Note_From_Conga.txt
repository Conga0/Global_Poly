I don't know why, but despite working perfectly fine earlier today with the same code, everything is broken now.

If possible, please boot it up on your machine and test if it's working on your local machine; or if it's just a my-machine issue.

I'm skeptical something broke engine side after I tried messing with the polymorph pool too many times but I can't be sure at this point without outside help.



If you're reading this and can quickly demo it for me, saying if it works or not, please do, thankyou.


I also left older versions of settings.lua in the "graveyard" folder if you want to try seeing if those work.














For anyone curious what exactly is breaking, it seems one of two things is happening
1. The Polymorph  table is being reset to the vanilla chaotic poly table everytime a creature is added or removed to it.

2. The PolymorphTableRemoveEntity isn't removing entries from the chaotic poly table

I'm not sure which.. maybe a mix of both, either way I'm 99% confident something broke engine side but would like outside help to test it if possible.
You just have to load the mod up ingame on beta branch and try configuring your polymorph pool, it should be quick to determine if it works by disabling everything then enabling all bosses.
Thankyou.
