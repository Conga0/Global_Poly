A noita mod which lets you control the chaotic polymorph pool and let you transform into anything!.
Wanted to turn into a boss?
A lukki?
Some weird gremlin?
Kolmisilma himself?!

Now you can with Poly Control!
Check mod settings ingame to configure your chaotic polymorph pool.

Note: Currently only works on the beta branch of Noita
Note: As this only works on the beta branch, which is prone to sudden changes, this mod may break.
If it does, please leave a comment and I'll fix it as soon as possible.
